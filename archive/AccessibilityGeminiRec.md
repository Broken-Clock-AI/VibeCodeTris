# Accessibility Recommendations for Tetris

This document outlines potential accessibility features to make the game more inclusive for a wider range of players. The options are categorized into four main areas: Visual, Motor, Auditory, and Cognitive.

---

### 1. Visual Accessibility

These options help players who have low vision, color blindness, or other visual impairments.

*   **High-Contrast Mode:** A special theme that uses a very simple color palette (e.g., black, white, and one bright color) to make the board, pieces, and ghost piece stand out clearly.
*   **Colorblind-Friendly Palettes:** Multiple color schemes tailored to different types of color blindness (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, etc.). The key is to ensure each piece's color is distinct from the others and the background.
*   **Distinct Piece Patterns:** In addition to color, each Tetrimino shape could have a unique, high-contrast pattern (dots, stripes, checkers) overlaid on it. This makes pieces distinguishable even in grayscale.
*   **Ghost Piece Customization:** Allow users to increase the opacity or change the style of the ghost piece (e.g., from a faint fill to a solid, bright outline) to make it easier to see.
*   **Reduce Flashing Effects:** An option to disable or reduce the intensity of flashing animations during line clears, which can be distracting or trigger photosensitivity.
*   **UI & Font Scaling:** The ability to increase the size of text for the score, level, and other HUD elements.
*   **Screen Reader Support:** This is more advanced, but crucial for blind players. The game would announce key events through a screen reader:
    *   "T piece spawned"
    *   "Piece locked"
    *   "Double line clear"
    *   "Hold is now L piece"
    *   On-demand board summary (e.g., "Highest point is column 5, row 12").

### 2. Motor Accessibility

These options assist players who may have difficulty with fine motor control, reaction time, or pressing multiple keys quickly.

*   **Customizable Game Speed:** Allow the player to set a maximum speed or even play in a mode where the speed never increases.
*   **Adjustable Key Timings (DAS/ARR):** This is one of the most important ones. Let the user fully customize:
    *   **DAS (Delayed Auto Shift):** The time you have to hold a key before the piece starts moving repeatedly.
    *   **ARR (Auto Repeat Rate):** How fast the piece moves once auto-shift kicks in.
*   **Remappable Controls:** Allow the user to rebind any action (move, rotate, hold, drop) to any key on the keyboard.
*   **Sticky Keys / Toggle Actions:** An option where you don't have to *hold* a key down. For example, tap "right" once to start the piece moving right, and tap it again to stop.
*   **One-Handed Layouts:** Pre-configured control schemes that group all essential keys close together for one-handed play.
*   **"No Lock Delay" Mode:** An option where pieces *only* lock into place when the player presses the "down" or "hard drop" key, removing the time pressure of the automatic lock timer.

### 3. Auditory Accessibility

These options help players who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who find audio distracting.

*   **Visual Cues for Audio Events:** If a sound effect is important (e.g., a "thud" when a piece is about to lock), provide a corresponding visual cue, like a subtle flash of the game border.
*   **Separate Volume Controls:** Sliders for Music, Sound Effects, and maybe even specific event sounds. This allows users to turn off distracting music while keeping helpful gameplay sounds.
*   **Subtitles/Captions:** While less common in Tetris, a small text area could announce events like "Level Up!" or "Tetris!" for players who have audio disabled.

### 4. Cognitive Accessibility

These options can reduce stress and cognitive load, making the game more approachable for a wider audience.

*   **"Zen Mode" / Practice Mode:** An endless mode with no increasing speed and no "Game Over." The goal is simply to clear lines at your own pace.
*   **Increase "Next" Piece Preview:** Allow the player to see more than just the next piece—perhaps the next 3 or 5 pieces—to aid in planning.
*   **Simplified HUD:** An option to hide less critical information (like score or lines) to reduce visual clutter and allow the player to focus only on the board.
*   **On-Screen Control Reminder:** A toggleable display that shows the current keybindings for core actions.
