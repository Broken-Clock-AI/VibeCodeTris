# Development Roadmap: Advanced Visual Customization

**Date:** 2025-10-17

## Strategic Initiative

With the **Visual Accessibility Foundation** now complete, the project is entering a new phase of development focused on **Advanced Visual Customization**.

This initiative moves beyond accessibility-first features to provide a rich, thematic, and highly varied visual experience for all users. The goal is to implement unique, detailed block styles that radically alter the game's appearance, paying tribute to classic games and exploring new aesthetic possibilities.

The next planned feature in this new phase is the implementation of the **"Faceted Gem"** block style. The work will be guided by the detailed approach outlined in the `FacetedGemImplementationPlan.md` document.

## Completed: Visual Accessibility Foundation

The previous strategic initiative is now complete. The following foundational features were implemented, creating a robust and scalable rendering pipeline that made the current phase possible:

*   **Centralized State Management:** A `UIStateManager` was created to manage all visual settings.
*   **Dynamic Renderer:** The `PixiRenderer` was refactored to be driven entirely by the state manager.
*   **Core Accessibility Features:**
    *   Selectable color palettes for color vision deficiencies.
    *   A high-contrast mode.
    *   Distinct piece patterns for identification without color.
*   **Quality of Life Visuals:**
    *   High-contrast piece outlines.
    *   Solid piece shape options.
