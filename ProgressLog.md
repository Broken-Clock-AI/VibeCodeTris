## Recent Progress (UI Scaffolding Pivot)

The team has successfully completed the strategic pivot to build the foundational UI shell. This unblocks all future UI-related feature development.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Game Over Logic:** The core `TetrisEngine` now correctly detects when a new piece cannot be spawned, sets a `gameOver` flag, and stops the game loop.

2.  **UI State Management:** A `UIStateManager` was created to manage transitions between different application views (e.g., Main Menu, In-Game, Game Over).

3.  **Multi-Screen UI:** The `index.html` was restructured to support multiple screens. Placeholder UI for the Main Menu, Settings, and Game Over screens is now in place.

4.  **First Accessibility Feature:** The first Tier 1 accessibility option, **Adjustable DAS/ARR**, has been implemented.
    *   Sliders were added to the Settings screen.
    *   The UI, renderer, worker, and engine were all updated to allow these timing values to be changed and applied in real-time.

5.  **Critical Bug Fix:** A "zombie listener" bug was identified and fixed. The issue caused the application to crash when starting a new game after a previous session had ended. The `renderAPI` now correctly cleans up its event listeners, ensuring stable game restarts.

## Current Known Issues

### 1. Player Controls Unresponsive

*   **Symptom:** All player controls (move left/right, rotate, drop, etc.) have stopped working. The game starts, but the piece cannot be controlled.
*   **Suspected Cause:** The refactoring of the `renderAPI.sendInput` method and the worker's message handler to support the new `setTimings` action object (`{ type: 'setTimings', ... }`) has likely introduced a mismatch in how standard string-based actions (e.g., `'moveLeft'`) are processed. The worker is likely no longer receiving these simple actions in the expected format.
*   **Next Step:** The immediate priority is to debug the input handling pipeline from `InputManager` -> `renderAPI` -> `worker.ts` to ensure the data format for player actions is consistent.
