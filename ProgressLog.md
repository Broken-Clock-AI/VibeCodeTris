## Visual Polish & Feature Completion

**Date:** 2025-10-20

A follow-up effort was made to address issues with recently implemented visual features, culminating in the successful implementation of the "Faceted Gem" style.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **"Faceted Gem" Style Fixed and Enabled:** The "Faceted Gem" block style, which had previously been reverted due to critical rendering bugs, has now been successfully fixed and is fully functional.
    *   **The Problem:** The original implementation used manual bitwise operations to calculate the different facet colors. This approach was flawed and resulted in incorrect color values, causing the gems to render as black and, in some cases, crash the application.
    *   **The Fix:** The rendering logic in `drawBlock` was refactored to use the robust, built-in `PIXI.Color` class for all color manipulations. By using methods like `.multiply()` to generate the highlight and shadow tones, the color calculations are now correct and safe, completely resolving the rendering bug.
    *   The feature is now stable, performs as expected, and has been re-enabled in the UI.

2.  **"Solid Pieces" Feature Fixed:** A significant visual bug in the "Solid Pieces" feature was resolved.
    *   **The Problem:** While the feature correctly rendered the active and settled pieces as solid shapes, it also had the unintended side effect of removing the grid lines from the empty parts of the playfield, making it difficult to see the board.
    *   **The Fix:** The rendering logic in `drawBlock` was updated to be more specific. It now checks if a block is an empty cell (`colorIndex === 0`) and, if so, *always* draws the border, regardless of the "Solid Pieces" setting. This successfully restored the background grid while keeping the pieces themselves solid.

## New QoL Feature: Ghost Piece - **COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2025-10-16

A high-impact quality-of-life feature, the "ghost piece" (or drop preview), has been successfully implemented. This feature enhances playability and accessibility by showing a semi-transparent preview of where the current piece will land.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Engine Logic:** The `TetrisEngine` was updated to calculate the ghost piece's final Y-coordinate on every tick. This data is now included in the game `Snapshot`, ensuring the renderer has the necessary information without duplicating logic.

2.  **State-Driven & Toggleable:** The feature is fully controlled by the `UIStateManager`. A new `isGhostPieceEnabled` flag was added to the central state, and a corresponding "Show Ghost Piece" checkbox was added to the settings menu.

3.  **Conditional Rendering:** The `PixiRenderer` now conditionally renders the ghost piece. It checks both the UI state flag and the presence of the ghost piece data in the snapshot before drawing the preview with a 40% opacity, ensuring it's distinct from the active piece.

4.  **Critical Bug Fix (Scope):** A `ReferenceError` was identified and fixed during validation. The renderer was attempting to use the `isGhostPieceEnabled` flag without correctly scoping it from its `visualSettings` property. The fix ensures the variable is correctly destructured, resolving the error and making the feature functional.

## Follow-Up Accessibility Features - **COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2025-10-15

Following the completion of the main accessibility initiative, two additional high-impact visual features were implemented.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **High-Contrast Piece Outline:** A new option was added to draw a continuous, high-contrast outline around the currently falling piece.
    *   The feature's implementation required significant debugging. The root cause of the outline not appearing was the use of deprecated Pixi.js v7 API calls (`lineStyle`, `drawRect`).
    *   The issue was resolved by migrating the rendering logic to the modern Pixi.js v8 API (`setStrokeStyle`, `stroke`), which fixed the bug and restored visibility.
    *   The thickness of the outline was fine-tuned to 3px for optimal visibility without being distracting.

2.  **Solid Piece Shapes:** A new option was added to render the falling piece as a single, solid shape without the internal block borders. This provides a cleaner, more modern aesthetic and can improve clarity for some users.

## New Initiative: Visual Accessibility Foundation - **COMPLETE**

**Date:** 2025-10-15

The "Visual Accessibility Foundation" initiative is now complete. This phase involved a significant refactor of the rendering pipeline to support a wide range of customizable visual options.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Centralized State Management:** The `UIStateManager` was successfully extended to manage all visual settings, creating a single source of truth and decoupling the renderer from the UI controls.

2.  **Dynamic Visual Options:** The `PixiRenderer` was refactored to be entirely state-driven. The following features were implemented:
    *   **Color Palettes:** Users can now choose between the default theme and three colorblind-friendly palettes (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia).
    *   **High-Contrast Mode:** A high-contrast mode with a black background and bright strokes is now available.
    *   **Distinct Piece Patterns:** A robust pattern system was implemented. After research and iterative feedback, the final implementation uses clean, rotation-invariant, and centered patterns superimposed over the piece's base color for maximum clarity.

3.  **Critical Bug Fix (Invisible Piece):** A critical bug was fixed where the falling piece was invisible. The root cause was a data mismatch: the engine was sending a direct hex color value, while the renderer expected a `colorIndex` to use with its theming system. The fix involved updating the engine to send the correct `colorIndex`, ensuring consistency with the rest of the rendering pipeline.

4.  **Critical Bug Fix (State Sync):** A `TypeError` in the renderer was identified and resolved. The renderer now correctly caches the last game snapshot to ensure that visual settings can be applied instantly without causing runtime errors.

5.  **UI Implementation:** The settings screen in `index.html` was updated with new controls for all the accessibility features, and these were successfully wired to the state manager in `main.ts`.

This work, guided by the `VisualAccessibilityProposal.md`, has resulted in a more flexible, accessible, and robust rendering engine.

## New Initiative: Visual Accessibility Foundation

**Date:** 2025-10-14

With the core application and UI shell now stable, the project is beginning a new strategic initiative focused on implementing high-impact, blendable visual accessibility features.

**Key Goals:**

1.  **Centralize State:** Refactor the `UIStateManager` to manage fine-grained visual settings, creating a single source of truth.
2.  **Implement UI Controls:** Add user-facing controls to the Settings menu for new visual options.
3.  **Enhance the Renderer:** Modify the `PixiRenderer` to be driven by the new state, allowing it to dynamically render different color palettes, high-contrast visuals, and distinct piece patterns.

This work is guided by the detailed plan in `VisualAccessibilityProposal.md` and is tracked in `ToDoList.md` under the "Phase 3.5" heading.

## Recent Progress (UI Scaffolding Pivot)

The team has successfully completed the strategic pivot to build the foundational UI shell. This unblocks all future UI-related feature development.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Game Over Logic:** The core `TetrisEngine` now correctly detects when a new piece cannot be spawned, sets a `gameOver` flag, and stops the game loop.

2.  **UI State Management:** A `UIStateManager` was created to manage transitions between different application views (e.g., Main Menu, In-Game, Game Over).

3.  **Multi-Screen UI:** The `index.html` was restructured to support multiple screens. Placeholder UI for the Main Menu, Settings, and Game Over screens is now in place.

4.  **First Accessibility Feature:** The first Tier 1 accessibility option, **Adjustable DAS/ARR**, has been implemented.
    *   Sliders were added to the Settings screen.
    *   The UI, renderer, worker, and engine were all updated to allow these timing values to be changed and applied in real-time.

5.  **Critical Bug Fix:** A "zombie listener" bug was identified and fixed. The issue caused the application to crash when starting a new game after a previous session had ended. The `renderAPI` now correctly cleans up its event listeners, ensuring stable game restarts.

## Recent Progress (Responsive UI Layout)

A significant effort was undertaken to diagnose and fix a series of complex layout issues that affected the application on both mobile and desktop.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Mobile Layout Fixed:** A critical bug where the on-screen touch controls were cut off on mobile devices has been resolved.
    *   The initial problem was diagnosed as an incorrect CSS `height` property.
    *   Several iterative solutions were implemented, culminating in a robust "fit-to-screen" layout.
    *   The application now uses JavaScript (`window.innerHeight`) to dynamically calculate the true available screen space, avoiding overlap from mobile browser UI elements.

2.  **Desktop Layout Fixed:** An issue where the mobile touch controls were incorrectly displayed on desktop has been resolved.
    *   CSS media queries have been implemented to ensure touch controls are *only* visible on touch-enabled devices or narrow viewports.

3.  **Unified Scaling Logic:** The game canvas and its surrounding border now scale perfectly on all devices.
    *   The resizing logic was made aspect-ratio-aware.
    *   JavaScript now dynamically resizes the game's container to match the canvas, a eliminating the "black gutter" artifacts and ensuring the border is always snug.

The application's layout is now stable and responsive across all target platforms.
