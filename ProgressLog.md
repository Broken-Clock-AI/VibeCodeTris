## New Initiative: Visual Accessibility Foundation

**Date:** 2025-10-14

With the core application and UI shell now stable, the project is beginning a new strategic initiative focused on implementing high-impact, blendable visual accessibility features.

**Key Goals:**

1.  **Centralize State:** Refactor the `UIStateManager` to manage fine-grained visual settings, creating a single source of truth.
2.  **Implement UI Controls:** Add user-facing controls to the Settings menu for new visual options.
3.  **Enhance the Renderer:** Modify the `PixiRenderer` to be driven by the new state, allowing it to dynamically render different color palettes, high-contrast visuals, and distinct piece patterns.

This work is guided by the detailed plan in `VisualAccessibilityProposal.md` and is tracked in `ToDoList.md` under the "Phase 3.5" heading.

## Recent Progress (UI Scaffolding Pivot)

The team has successfully completed the strategic pivot to build the foundational UI shell. This unblocks all future UI-related feature development.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Game Over Logic:** The core `TetrisEngine` now correctly detects when a new piece cannot be spawned, sets a `gameOver` flag, and stops the game loop.

2.  **UI State Management:** A `UIStateManager` was created to manage transitions between different application views (e.g., Main Menu, In-Game, Game Over).

3.  **Multi-Screen UI:** The `index.html` was restructured to support multiple screens. Placeholder UI for the Main Menu, Settings, and Game Over screens is now in place.

4.  **First Accessibility Feature:** The first Tier 1 accessibility option, **Adjustable DAS/ARR**, has been implemented.
    *   Sliders were added to the Settings screen.
    *   The UI, renderer, worker, and engine were all updated to allow these timing values to be changed and applied in real-time.

5.  **Critical Bug Fix:** A "zombie listener" bug was identified and fixed. The issue caused the application to crash when starting a new game after a previous session had ended. The `renderAPI` now correctly cleans up its event listeners, ensuring stable game restarts.

## Recent Progress (Responsive UI Layout)

A significant effort was undertaken to diagnose and fix a series of complex layout issues that affected the application on both mobile and desktop.

**Key Accomplishments:**

1.  **Mobile Layout Fixed:** A critical bug where the on-screen touch controls were cut off on mobile devices has been resolved.
    *   The initial problem was diagnosed as an incorrect CSS `height` property.
    *   Several iterative solutions were implemented, culminating in a robust "fit-to-screen" layout.
    *   The application now uses JavaScript (`window.innerHeight`) to dynamically calculate the true available screen space, avoiding overlap from mobile browser UI elements.

2.  **Desktop Layout Fixed:** An issue where the mobile touch controls were incorrectly displayed on desktop has been resolved.
    *   CSS media queries have been implemented to ensure touch controls are *only* visible on touch-enabled devices or narrow viewports.

3.  **Unified Scaling Logic:** The game canvas and its surrounding border now scale perfectly on all devices.
    *   The resizing logic was made aspect-ratio-aware.
    *   JavaScript now dynamically resizes the game's container to match the canvas, eliminating the "black gutter" artifacts and ensuring the border is always snug.

The application's layout is now stable and responsive across all target platforms.
