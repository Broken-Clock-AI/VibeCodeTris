### **Comprehensive Accessibility Plan for VibeCodeTris**

**Goal:** To ensure every player, regardless of sensory, motor, or cognitive difference, can experience the flow, rhythm, and creative energy of VibeCodeTris on their own terms.

---

### **1. Visual Accessibility**

*   **Color & Contrast:**
    *   **High-Contrast Mode:** An alternate theme with enhanced outlines and brighter pieces on a darker, simpler background for maximum clarity.
    *   **Colorblind-Friendly Palettes:** Multiple preset color schemes tailored for deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia.
*   **Shape & Pattern Recognition:**
    *   **Distinct Piece Patterns:** In addition to color, each Tetrimino shape will have a unique, high-contrast surface pattern (dots, stripes, etc.) to make them distinguishable in grayscale.
*   **Clarity & Focus:**
    *   **Customizable Ghost Piece:** Allow players to adjust the opacity and style (e.g., filled vs. outline) of the ghost piece.
    *   **Adjustable Grid Opacity:** Let players control the visibility of the background grid lines.
    *   **UI & Font Scaling:** The ability to increase the size of all HUD text and interface elements.
*   **Effects & Animation:**
    *   **Reduce Visual Effects:** An option to disable or reduce the intensity of flashing animations and screen shake during line clears to prevent photosensitivity issues or distraction.
*   **Advanced Support:**
    *   **Screen Reader Support:** Announce key game events (e.g., "T piece spawned," "Double line clear," "Hold is now L piece") and provide an on-demand board summary for blind players.

### **2. Motor & Input Accessibility**

*   **Control Customization:**
    *   **Full Key Remapping:** Allow any game action to be rebound to any key or controller button.
    *   **One-Handed Layouts:** Provide presets for one-handed keyboard play.
    *   **One-Button Play Mode:** A simplified mode where a single button cycles through actions, for players with significant motor limitations.
*   **Timing & Speed Adjustments:**
    *   **Adjustable DAS/ARR:** Sliders to customize the Delayed Auto Shift and Auto Repeat Rate timings.
    *   **Adjustable Soft Drop Speed:** Allow players to control how fast the piece moves during a soft drop.
    *   **"No Lock Delay" Mode:** An option where pieces only lock when the player manually drops them, removing time pressure.
*   **Input Leniency:**
    *   **Sticky Keys / Toggle Actions:** An option where movement isn't held. Tap a direction once to start moving, tap again to stop.
    *   **Input Buffering:** Forgiving input timing that allows late rotations or movements just before a piece locks.
    *   **Pause-Buffer Leniency:** Prevent a piece from instantly hard-dropping if the player was holding "down" when they unpause the game.

### **3. Auditory Accessibility**

*   **Volume Controls:**
    *   **Separate Volume Sliders:** Independent controls for Music, Sound Effects, and other audio channels.
*   **Visual Feedback:**
    *   **Visual Cues for Audio Events:** A visual flash or pulse on the UI to accompany critical sound effects like piece lock, hold, or line clears.
    *   **Visual Rhythm Indicators:** An optional UI element that pulses in sync with the music's beat.
*   **Alternative Formats:**
    *   **Subtitles/Captions:** A small, toggleable text box that announces game events like "Level Up!" or "Tetris!"
    *   **Low-Frequency Feedback:** Optional vibration or a visual pulse for line clears and other major events.

### **4. Cognitive & Processing Accessibility**

*   **Game Pacing & Difficulty:**
    *   **"Zen Mode" / Practice Mode:** An endless mode with no increasing speed and no "Game Over" state.
    *   **Adjustable Speed Curve:** Allow players to choose a slower progression of game speed.
*   **Reducing Cognitive Load:**
    *   **Simplified Visuals:** An option to disable flashy backgrounds or complex animations to help with focus.
    *   **Increased "Next" Piece Preview:** Let the player see up to 5 upcoming pieces to aid in planning.
    *   **On-Screen Control Reminder:** A toggleable display showing the current keybindings.
    *   **Tutorial & Pacing Cues:** An optional mode that visually suggests optimal piece placements for beginners.

### **5. Experimental / "Vibe" Accessibility**

*   **Sensory Customization:**
    *   **Synesthetic Mode:** Allow players to customize how piece types map to color, sound, and vibration.
    *   **Mood-Based Palettes:** Themes like "Calm," "Neon," or "Night" that change the game's entire aesthetic.
*   **Adaptive Experience:**
    *   **Adaptive Lighting/Audio:** Ambient game effects that respond to the player's rhythm, speed, or stress level.
    *   **Focus Assist:** An option that automatically dims non-essential UI elements as the game speed increases.
