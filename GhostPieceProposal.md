# Proposal: Ghost Piece (Drop Preview) Implementation

This document outlines the proposal and implementation plan for adding a "ghost piece" or "drop preview" feature to the game.

---

## 1. Feature Description

The "ghost piece" feature provides a real-time visual indicator of where the currently falling piece will land if it were to be hard-dropped. It renders a semi-transparent or stylized silhouette of the piece at the bottom of the playfield.

This feature will be enhanced with an optional "beam" effectâ€”a subtle visual element that connects the active piece to its ghost, further clarifying its trajectory.

Both the ghost piece and the beam effect will be toggleable in the settings menu.

## 2. Justification for Immediate Integration

Integrating this feature now is highly strategic for several reasons:

1.  **Significant Quality-of-Life (QoL) Enhancement:** This is a standard feature in modern Tetris-like games for a reason. It dramatically reduces player error, increases gameplay speed, and lowers the cognitive load required to play effectively. It allows for more fluid and confident piece placement.

2.  **Direct Accessibility Improvement:** By providing a clear, unambiguous preview of the piece's destination, we make the game more accessible to a wider range of players, including those with cognitive or spatial reasoning challenges. This aligns perfectly with the project's recently completed accessibility initiatives.

3.  **Leverages Existing Architecture:** The timing is ideal. The rendering engine has just been refactored to be state-driven, and the game engine already possesses the core logic needed to calculate the final drop position. Implementing the ghost piece is a natural extension of the current, flexible architecture.

4.  **High Impact, Low Risk:** The logic for this feature is self-contained and has a low risk of introducing bugs into the core engine. The visual components can be added cleanly to the renderer without disrupting existing functionality.

## 3. High-Level Implementation Plan

The implementation can be broken down into three main parts:

### Part 1: Engine Logic (`engine.ts`)

1.  **Calculate Ghost Position:** Create a new function, `calculateGhostPosition()`, that takes the current piece and the board state as input.
2.  This function will simulate dropping the piece one row at a time until a collision is detected. The position just before the collision is the ghost's `y` coordinate.
3.  **Add to Game Snapshot:** The ghost piece's coordinates (`ghostY`) will be added to the game state snapshot that is sent to the renderer on every tick. This ensures the renderer always has the information it needs without duplicating logic.

### Part 2: Renderer (`pixiRenderer.ts`)

1.  **Render Ghost Piece:** In the main render loop, check the game snapshot for the `ghostY` coordinate.
2.  If it exists, draw the current piece's shape at the calculated `(x, ghostY)` position.
3.  The ghost piece will be rendered with a distinct style (e.g., 50% opacity or a unique fill) to differentiate it from the active piece. This style will be managed by the theme/palette system.
4.  **(Optional) Render Beam Effect:** If the feature is enabled, render a simple visual effect (e.g., two vertical lines) stretching from the bottom of the active piece to the top of the ghost piece.

### Part 3: UI and State Management (`main.ts`, `index.html`)

1.  **Add State Flags:** Add two new boolean flags to the `UIStateManager`: `isGhostPieceEnabled` and `isBeamEffectEnabled`.
2.  **Add UI Controls:** Add two new checkboxes to the settings panel in `index.html` to control these flags.
3.  **Connect Controls:** Wire up the new checkboxes in `main.ts` to update the `UIStateManager`.
4.  **Pass State to Renderer:** The renderer will already have access to the state manager, so it can dynamically show or hide the ghost piece and beam based on the user's settings.
