This file tracks the build and development process.

**Commit: `[Will be generated]`**
*   **Date:** 2025-10-10
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `fix(renderer): Correct critical rendering bugs and API usage`
*   **Details:**
    *   Fixed a critical rendering bug where falling pieces were invisible until they locked. The renderer was incorrectly using the piece's final color value as an index into the color palette.
    *   Resolved all PixiJS v8 deprecation warnings by updating the graphics drawing methods (`beginFill`, `lineStyle`, `drawRect`) to the modern API (`fill`, `stroke`, `rect`).
    *   Fixed a TypeScript error in the `destroy` method by removing an invalid `basePath` property from the options.
    *   The renderer is now stable, warning-free, and correctly displays all game elements.

*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(renderer): Implement visual renderer and fix critical bugs`
*   **Details:**
    *   Set up the frontend build system using Vite and installed PixiJS.
    *   Created the `RenderAPI` to act as a bridge between the UI and the logic worker.
    *   Implemented an MVP `PixiRenderer` that draws the game board and pieces based on snapshots from the worker.
    *   Fixed a critical bug related to incorrect asynchronous initialization in PixiJS v8.
    *   Refactored the logic worker to be fully browser-compatible by removing Node.js-specific APIs.
    *   Fixed a fatal "detached ArrayBuffer" crash by ensuring the engine sends a *copy* of the board state to the renderer.
    *   The result is a fully functional, end-to-end pipeline with a visible, running game.

*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(worker): Implement resilient worker and communication layer`
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented a fully isomorphic message router in `worker.ts` to handle the engine lifecycle, user input, and crash recovery.
    *   Added robust snapshot validation in `recover.ts`, including checksum and version checks, to ensure data integrity.
    *   Updated the `TetrisEngine` to produce verifiable snapshots with checksums and to handle user input.
    *   Created a suite of integration tests (`worker.test.ts`) to verify the entire worker lifecycle, including start, recovery, and message sequencing.
    *   Fixed all related TypeScript and logic bugs, resulting in all 13 tests passing.
    *   This commit completes Phase 2 of the project plan.

**Commit: `ea07e22`**
*   **Date:** 2025-10-10
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(engine): Implement line clearing and scoring logic`
*   **Details:**
    *   Aligned core data structures (`types.ts`) and engine snapshots with the refined project specification.
    *   Implemented line clearing and scoring logic in the engine.
    *   Added a unit test to verify the new gameplay mechanics.
    *   Scaffolded `worker.ts` and `recover.ts` for Phase 2.
    *   All tests are passing, marking the completion of Phase 1.

**Commit: `[Will be generated]`**
*   **Date:** 2025-10-10
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(engine): Implement gravity and piece locking`
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented the core gravity loop in the engine's `tick()` method.
    *   Added piece locking and merging logic to the board.
    *   Added and refined unit tests for gravity and locking behavior.
    *   Diagnosed and fixed a critical bug in the `isValidPosition` function that was causing incorrect collision detection.
    *   All unit tests are now passing, confirming the core mechanics are working deterministically.

*   **Date:** 2025-10-10
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(engine): Implement 7-bag and piece spawning`
*   **Details:**
    *   Implemented the deterministic 7-bag piece generator using the PRNG.
    *   Added piece spawning logic to the engine.
    *   Refactored the engine to spawn the first piece on the first tick, not in the constructor.
    *   Added and updated unit tests to verify the bag's determinism and correct piece spawning.
    *   All tests passed successfully.

**Commit: `cbd6bfa`**
*   **Date:** 2025-10-10
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(logic): Implement Phase 1 core logic and tests`
*   **Details:**
    *   Added initial implementations for `rng.ts`, `rules.ts`, and `engine.ts`.
    *   Created unit tests for each of the core logic modules.
    *   Set up the TypeScript environment with `ts-node` and a `tsconfig.json`.
    *   Fixed a bug in the rotation test and verified all tests pass.
    *   This commit completes the initial scaffolding of the deterministic core engine as outlined in Phase 1 of the project plan.

**Commit: `72a2561`**
*   **Date:** 2025-10-10
*   **Author:** Gemini
*   **Summary:** `feat(logic): Scaffold core data structures and constants`
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `types.ts` with the fully-defined `Snapshot` and `GameEvent` schemas, establishing the core data contract for the.
    *   Created `constants.ts` to define game parameters like TPS, DAS, ARR, and board dimensions.
    *   These files align with the refined project specification and form the foundation for the deterministic engine.
